        " u'question': u'In 2005, one founder of this school of thought reflected on its history in the short essay Forty Good Years; that founder also wrote a 1995 \"autobiography\" of this idea. Another early member of this school wrote a 1979 work about leaving his social circle of New York cultural elites titled Breaking Ranks: A Political Memoir. Apart from Norman Podhoretz, one member of this school compared European and American attitudes towards the use of force, concluding that Europe\\'s military weakness makes it likely to favor diplomacy rather than war; that work was called Of Paradise and Power. Another member of this school authored The Unipolar Moment after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Many early members of this school were students of Leo Strauss at the University of Chicago in the 1960\\'s. In the 1990\\'s, members of this school wrote a letter to Bill Clinton which began with the sentence \"American foreign policy is adrift\" and went on to serve as the foundational document of PNAC. This school seeks to bring about world peace by promoting free trade and liberal democracy through the use of force and American hegemony. For ten points, name this school of thought associated with Irving Kristol, Robert Kagan, Charles Krauthammer, John Bolton, Paul Wolfowitz, and the Bush administration\\'s foreign policy.',\n",
