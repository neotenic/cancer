During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, this was the only town from which the Merchants Staples permitted English wool to be exported. A treaty named for this place gave control of Aquitaine to Edward III in return for Edward renouncing claims to the throne of France and promised the release from captivity of Jean II; that treaty is also known as the Treaty of Bretigny. The duke of Guise conquered it in 1558, thereby removing the last English foothold in France. In the wake of the Battle of Crecy, it was besieged by English troops until six of the town's leaders volunteered as hostages. For 10 points, name this French port which, in 1346, made heroes of those \"burghers.\"\n",

This man had a vision of a \"monstrous flood\" devastating Europe shortly before the outbreak of World War One and he wrote about a \"God who knew no moderation in his emotion\" in his Answer to Job. He discussed a term that defines two supposedly unrelated events that are still linked in some way. Along with synchronicity, he developed ideas between those who enjoyed internal and external activities in his theory on introversion and extroversion. He used the term syzygy to describe the male and female aspects known as the animus and anima, as well as a concept that he defined as the \"reservoir of the experiences of our species\". FTP, identify this psychologist noted for his concepts of archetypes and collective unconsciousness.\n",

He wrote a piece titled La mere et l'enfant, originally for piano four hands, and contains a section called \"Petite Romance.\" He based his Six melodies on poems by Victor Hugo, and his Trio in C minor shows some influence by Beethoven. Arthur Coquard finished this composer's four-act opera La Jacquerie, and this composer also wrote a ballet that contains a \"Pas des cymbals\" and some \"Danses marocaines.\" One of his operas was based on Schiller's Die Vershworung des Fiesco zu Genua, and another of his operas sees Magared betraying her father's city to Karnac and is based on a Breton legend. He worked with Adolphe Fischer on one of his better known pieces, and another may have anticipated the release of Bizet's Carmen a month later with a first movement habanera. For 10 points, identify this French composer of the ballet Namouna, the operas Fiesque and Le roi d'Ys, and the Cello Concerto in D minor, perhaps best known for a piece dedicated to Sarasate, Symphonie Espagnole.\n",
